		<img src="img1.jpg" style="height: 100px;width: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 10px">
		<p> The Catalan club are attempting to turn the heads of their top targets as they desperately seek a replacement for Neymar by the end of this month.<br>It is one of the worst-kept secrets in football. Tapping up of players has existed as long as transfers themselves and, even though it is against the rules, it happens all the time. This summer, however, Barcelona are taking the practice to extreme levels.<a href="">(read more...)</a></p>

		<header><h3>Wenger concedes Alexis Sanchez to leave Arsenal for Free in 2018	</h3></header>
		
		<p>There has been "no progress" in attempts to tie the attacker down to a new deal, although the Frenchman is not ready to freeze out one of his stars.<br>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says that it is a distinct possibility that Alexis Sanchez will leave the club for free next summer. The Gunners boss says there has been no progress made in reaching a renewal for the 28-year-old attacker, whose deal is up next June, though that will not stop Wenger playing the Chilean.<a href="">(read more...)</a></p>

		<header style=""><h3>Like a broken record, Chelsea continue to promise at least three new signings</h3></header>
		<p> I wonder if Matt Law of the Telegraph(and all other Chelsea beat writers) are as tired of writing about this as I am. Or maybe they are just reusing old passages? That would be pretty smart. Instead, here I am, like a chump, writing about the same old Tom Tit as last week, last two weeks, last month. Chelsea ready to step up transfer activity with Marina Granovskaia set to be the hardest working woman, man, corporate entity, or sentient robot involved in football these days. 	<a href="">(read more...)</a></p>

		<header><h3>Marcos Alonso restores the natural order of things as Chelsea beat Spurs at Wembley</h3></header>
		<img src="img3.jpg" style="height: 130px;width: 175px; float: left; margin-right: 10px">
		<p>Unlike Chelsea, Tottenham have not had too many good moments at Wembley. They have not beaten Chelsea there since the 2008 League Cup final and won just once in five tries last season in the various European and cup games they hosted there as they prepared to move out of White Hart Lane. Facing the prospect of having to play a full seasons worth of home games in the national stadium, they had been hoping to change that narrative. Chelsea were out to change a narrative of their own, that of the early-season crisis. Only one of those intentions could succeed in the end, and unsurprisingly,it was not Spurs.<a href="">(read more...)</a></p>
